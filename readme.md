This is a flight fare prediction model that uses a random forest regression algorithm to predict the price of a flight based on several factors such as the airline name, departure and destination airports, number of stops, and departure/arrival times. The model is trained on a dataset that contains historical flight information and corresponding fares.

To build the model, we used the scikit-learn library in Python to implement the random forest regression algorithm. We also preprocessed the data to handle missing values, convert categorical features into numerical values, and normalize the numerical data.

After training the model on the dataset, we evaluated its accuracy using mean squared error (MSE) and obtained an accuracy of approximately 93.45%. This high accuracy suggests that the model is able to effectively predict flight fares based on the input features.

Overall, this flight fare prediction model can be useful for both consumers and airlines, as it can provide insight into expected pricing for flights and help inform purchasing decisions. The code for this project is available on Github for anyone who wants to use or further develop the model.
